# Whisper (For Cantonese)
The file description of ID2223_Lab2 and the answers of Task 2.
# Whisper-offline
The is the code of inference program (Hugging Face Space), which can achieve: 1. Allow users to upload audio files locally and output transcribed text. 2. Allow users to speak into the microphone and transcribe what he/she says. 3. Allow users to paste the URL of the audio file, and transcribe what is spoken.
# Whisper-online
The is the code of inference program (Hugging Face Space), which can achieve: Allows users to speak into a microphone and output transcribed text online in real time.
# whisper-small-hi
This is a whisper-small model that has been fine-tuned and trained, and can be used to transcribe Cantonese and output text.
# zh-HK-radio
These are some Cantonese audio clips that can be used to test the hugging face program to verify the effectiveness of the model.
# whisper_feature_pipeline.ipynb / .py
The is the feature engineering pipeline which can be used to run feature engineering on CPUs
# whisper_training_pipeline.ipynb / .py
The is the training pipeline which can be used to fine-tune and train the whisper model on GPUs
